          <h2>Tiwi Beach Resort Meals   </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Tiwi Beach Hotel is in a quiet, unspoilt beach resort with a unique setting on the Tiwi beach surrounded by acres of natural land. When we began planning for a beach front restaurant, we knew that the design would have to be different and would need to blend into the surrounding beach and gardens. Our Head Chef oversees the kitchen and prepares the menu and specials each week using only the freshest ingredients which are all locally sourced. Being at the Kenyan coast, Seafood is of course front and center with local fishermen delivering their catch of Lobster, Prawns, Snapper, Tuna and more every day. The rest of menu comprises of international favorites along with some Italian Pizza and Buggers and American beef steaks and the classic English Fish and Chips and Thai influences. The majority of the fresh produce we use is grown in our 100% organic vegetable shamba “farm”, located at Tiwi beach Hotel. We have a few favorites that hold their spot on our core menu, which changes seasonally. Our most popular items would be; Tuna Carpaccio, Crispy Calamari or Fresh Diani Oysters to start. Then a Seafood Platter, our famous “Zanzibar Snappers” or Ginger Crab as a main course. And to finish off, try a Nutty Chocolate Brownie, Banoffee Pot or Homemade Ice-Cream to satisfy your sweet tooth. Whilst the structure is superb and the cuisine will tantalise your tastebuds, the setting for your lunch or dinner is truly an assault on all of your senses. Lunches serve up a cocktail of turquoise hues as the gentle Indian Ocean laps up and down the expanse of white sand. Low tide is extra dramatic with almost half a kilometer of beach opening out towards the most superb mixture of blue and green colours that add so much to the dining experience. Coming for dinner? Sundowners before a full moon are truly spectacular. Sip on your aperitif and simply watch the show. A well-timed reservation can result in a beach that’s almost entirely illuminated by the Moon above.

          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Sand Island Beach is comprised of ten <b>fully furnished self-contained</b> and <b>self-catering cottages</b> which sleep between 2 and 20 pax depending on which one you take - on a pristine piece of Kenya's south coast. It geography offers guests something unique: a private & secluded beach, on the gorgeous Indian Ocean. Set in acres of orchards and indigenous coastal bush and just meters from the beach, there is a real sense of space and peace. We will arrange airport transfers, assist with shopping and offer advice on local attractions and adventures. We are owner managed and pride ourselves on our hosting and our extraordinary location. We also offer contract skilled chefs if required. <b>Sand Island Beach Cottages Tiwi</b> are located on the best beach in Kenya. You wake up a deserted shell strewn idyll, you look to the right and see nothing but palms teetering on the edge of coral cliffs. To the left is a series of caves. Peer up through sea holes in the roof and you can see the claw-like roots of mangrove trees and the underside of the dense foliage that is typical of the coastline; pod mahogany’s, jackfruit, coconut palms and baobab. Seaside caper climbs over the cliff edges, white flowers dancing in the gentle breeze. Ahead is the blue ocean, turquoise at first but beyond the white waves that mark the line of reef, the sea turns dark blue. The reef, a coral drops off frequented by sharks, ray and passing whales. And by turtles and eels and a million multi-colored fish and corals. Closer to shore small sandbars create pools. Places to lie in the scorching sun, places to snorkel and look for shells and urchins. Sandbars – a walkway for crabs a parkour playground for kids. The beach is white in colour and made of a million tiny shells, a beachcomber’s dream. For those in the know, there are places where the waves have crushed the sand into a fine powder. Play school putty, ankles sink into the softest whitest sand imaginable. On this beach there is nobody for company but the ghost crabs that race in and out of sandy homes. Chasing the sea in and out.   In and out. The tides roll in and out. The seasons too but Sand Island Beach Cottages, Tiwi, remains the same. Timeless. <b>Sand Island Beach</b> is one of the best beaches in Kenya. You can take <b>Diani Beach & Galu Beach</b> with their kilometers of blinding white sand. You can leave <b>Watamu</b> with its coral islands and Marine Park. For us, it’s all about the beaches in Tiwi. The changing face of a single place. Tide out and it’s a subaquatic wonderland of crabs and starfish of pools to daydream in and islands to swim to. Tide in and the Indian Ocean washing machine picks you up and slams you beach bound in a giddy, salt drenched roller coaster. Here at Sand Island Beach Cottages, there are no frills, no pools, no parks, and no bar. The sea and this beach are everything and it is all you need. <b>Sand Island Beach</b> is a collection of beach cottages a world away from Tiwi Beach Resorts. They sit for the most part jumbled on top of each other. Each cottage is charmingly individual. Pweza is the only two-storey building. Badu sits in front of the other houses and has a deck that promises privacy and tranquility. Tafi is plopped in the middle of the row, its sprawling deck offering space and prime beach viewing. Toward the left Papa and Kasa sit slightly apart, fronted by pea green grass and frangipani trees. These are larger and quieter houses. Every Sand Island Tiwi Beach cottage has a magnificent view of Tiwi beach. They come with huge comfy beds with thick cotton sheets and adorable kanga bedspreads. There is hot water in the bathrooms and free Wi-Fi throughout. Fishermen come to <b>Sand Island Beach Cottages</b> daily. Choose from what they have or order something special.

Sand Island is family-owned and the family extends to the locals that complete this little piece of paradise. Provided you make a quick run to <b>Diani</b> for basic essentials, oil, bread, fruit, eggs, sausages, bacon then the Sand Island community makes sure you have everything you need. Freshly delivered.

Not so long ago the starfish were decimated by entrepreneurs who dried them out and sold them to tourists as souvenirs; the locals have made a stand. Now the sand island is an unofficial marine park and the starfish number 2000.  This spectacular site can only be reached via <b>Sand Island</b> or a huge walk along the reef from Tiwi beach. The saucer-sized starfish range in colour from scarlet to blue with orange spots. Sand Island Tiwi beach is actually is situated on <b>Maweni beach</b>, slightly further north of Tiwi Beach.

            <h2>Tiwi Beach Kenya </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              <b>Tiwi Beach</b> is located North of <b>Diani Beach</b> in the South Coast of Kenya, the white sandy beaches of Tiwi are ideal for <b>family holidays</b> and honeymoon holidays, Tiwi beach sits 1.5 hours to the south of Mombasa and a 20-minute drive to the larger town of Diani beach where you will find shops, beach restaurants and the opportunity to kite surf, windsurf or dive, Tiwi is 7km north of <b>Ukunda Diani airport</b>. Access to the beach is free. If you are staying in Diani beach, the easiest way to reach the spot is to grab a tuk-tuk or a taxi to the end of the coastal road, just north of Diani - ask to be dropped off at the Kongo Mosque. Reach the beach and then walk north (to the left when facing the ocean) for about 1km. On the way, just after the mosque, you will have to cross the Kongo river estuary, sometimes with water up to above the knee. You can also be dropped off directly at <b>Tiwi Beach</b> by <b>car hire</b> or taxi or tuktuk but this represents a detour of nearly 2km from Diani, the road bypassing the estuary. Tiwi Beach is one of the most beautiful free shore access <b>snorkeling</b> spots in Diani. Clownfish in anemone, ghost pipefish, cowfish, starfish and small moray eels… each exploration holds its share of surprises. A shallow spot accessible to everyone, not to be missed if you are staying in the area. A unique part of Kenya, <b>Tiwi beach</b> is an off-the-beaten-track vacation destination for intrepid travelers. Tiwi Beach, Kenya slumbers under emerald palms and piercing blue skies. White sand is speckled with shells as big as your fist and coral caves hide secrets and treasures. <b>Tiwi Beach</b> is the lesser-known sister to <b>Diani Beach</b>. No less beautiful, just different. Where Diani is striking with soft sand so white it hurts to look at its Tiwi beach is soft white. At Tiwi beach there are <b>No beach bars</b> or beach restaurants but only one beach resort, the coastline is dotted with small fisherman style cottages and larger <b>luxurious beach villas</b>. Tiwi residents guard their secret fiercely unwilling to share it with tourists, and it’s not hard to see why.  At Tiwi beach the reef comes close to the shore, a rock pooling playground a low tide, revealing unusually shaped pools large enough to snorkel in and filled with tropical fish. Sand bars stretch out to the reef filled with rainbow colored star fish and naked sea urchins waiting to be picked up. Tiwi, Kenya is a seaside dream, a tropical Indian ocean beach nearly untouched by tourism. The reef lies just offshore, and there are good snorkeling opportunities at high tide, especially at the northern end.  The clear pluses for <b>Tiwi beach</b> are fewer tourists which translates to fewer beach boys. In the low tide, you can walk to the south end of Tiwi Beach and wade across the <b>Mwachema River</b> to Diani Beach and the ancient Kongo Mosque, right next to the <b>Indian Ocean Beach Resort</b>. You can catch the local TukTuk from Indian Ocean beach resort to the supermarkets, restaurants and shops along Diani beach. It is a great choice for, <b>beach holidays</b> for those who want to spend their moments of fresh and lazy sand and sun bathing. Many water sports are available like wind surfing, kite boarding, snorkeling, scuba diving, deep sea fishing and more. The numerous and most visited diving sites in south coast makes diving in Tiwi Beach a memorable experience for divers. The site houses hard and soft corals and marine life. <b>Tiwi Turtles</b> are a great attraction in this diving spot and surprisingly the turtle eggs can be seen on the beach line. The reef <b>Tiwi whale</b> and <b>Tiwi sharks</b> are seen here and are a great attraction for most divers.

            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              Tiwi Beach, Kenya has a limited number of choices in terms of accommodation. All the viable options for tourists are along the coastline, the interior between the coast and the Likoni – Mombasa Road is populated with small local houses, palms, shambas and the occasional winding sandy road.  Along the Tiwi coastline the only resorts are the Amani Beach Resort Tiwi – Closed - and the <b>Hill Park Hotel Tiwi Beach</b>  
   
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              <h2>Tiwi Weather, Kenya</h2>
              The weather in <b>Tiwi Kenya</b> is warm most of the year.  Even in winter it can be very hot in the day time, but at night when the wind blows and the rain thrums on the rooftop’s long trousers and even a sweater are advised. In the summer it can be punishingly hot, most Tiwi houses make use of the sea winds but air conditioning should be considered if you aren’t right up close to the ocean. When to <b>visit Tiwi Beach</b> - There is no bad time to visit Tiwi beach. Tiwi weather in the cooler winter months of July & August is pleasant as the humidity drops, the wind picks up and you might just get to snuggle in a light sweater at night.   During the rest of the year Tiwi is hot, hot, hot. The rains fall in April – June and October – November but it rarely rains the whole day

            <h2>Visit the Africa Pool </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              The <b>Tiwi Africa Pool</b> is miracle of nature! Right here on a country that straddles the African part of the equator there is a pool shaped just like the African continent.  Carved by the sea and the wind out of the coral reef, the large pool sits next to the cliffs at Tiwi. Shaped like Africa it is close enough to leap into from the nearby cliffs and perfect for snorkeling.  I’ve seen lionfish, octopus, starfish as well as the usual suspects: surgeon fish, sergeant fish, gobies, clownfish and eels. There is even a cave you can swim through from East Africa to Madagascar.  The pool is a 10-minute walk along reef so only accessible at low tide.  Go in a large group or with a local guide as there have been some robberies along the way. 
              
   
            </p>
            <h2>Hike to the starfish</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            To the north of Maweni beach is a sandbar beloved by starfish. While the starfish can be found all over the coast, they gather in larger numbers in this particular spot to feast on sea urchins.  There are two types of large star fish and they come in all colours and sizes. If you go with a guide, they will fill you in on all the star fish facts: how they eat, how to tell male from female and lots of other starfish know how. The guides ask you to take them out of the water for photographs but I have come to understand this is dangerous for the star fish and can cause them to die.  It’s a magical trip, trekking across the reef at low tide; finding a sandy cove filled with huge star fish…memories to last a life time.

            The spotter aircraft hovers over the turquoise ocean and helps to spot the gentle giants. Then the special moment is here, you will swim with the giants of the oceans, which glide calmly through the water. The up to 13 meters long and about 12 tons heavy animals are peaceful and kind creatures that float silently through the ocean. They are the largest shark and at the same time the largest fish of our earth. They are toothless and feed on plankton and small fish and are completely harmless. Experience a fascinating underwater encounter that you will never forget.                       
          </p>

          <h2>Swahili Excursion</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The life at Kenya’s coast is still very traditional. On this trip you will visit <b>Shimoni village</b>, a typical costal village with its huts and small streets and tiny shops. Here, life has another paste and the village’s inhabitants are very friendly. You will also get to know about the dark and painful history of slavery and visit slave caves. Later on, you will visit the beautiful <b>Wasini Island</b> and its coral garden where you can stroll around. Discover plenty of birds while you walk through the mangroves on a wooden board walk and enjoy the sea breeze.       
 
          </p> 
          <h2>Shimba Hills Daytrip</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Safari starts at 6:00 am – you will be picked up and drive to the Shimba Hills National Reserve (approx. 1 hour). Along the way you will immediately notice the breath-taking landscapes and change of scenery. The first game drive will take you deep into the rainforest where you will explore your surroundings and track the animals living in the area. Guided by a ranger, you will stop at the Sheldrick Waterfall where magnificent views await you and walk down to the refreshing freshwater pool (approx. 2 hours in total – please bring drinking water, good walking shoes, swimsuit, sun screen and a towel) At around noon you can look forward to a mouth-watering four-course lunch served on the wooden veranda of the SHIMBA HILLS LODGE, overlooking the waterhole. The natural environment is such that you can expect the curious little resident squirrels to join you. After lunch you will go on another game drive before we drive you back to Tiwi Beach Hotel in the late afternoon.

          <h2>How to get to Tiwi Beach </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Tiwi Beach Kenya sits approximately 1.5 hours to the south of <b>Mombasa Kenya’s</b> second largest city and closest international airport. It is 20-minute drive from Diani Beach, which has lots of shops, restaurants and places to stay as well as a well serviced local airport. Tiwi Beach is about 3 hours from <b>Watamu</b> and <b>Malindi</b>, the next largest coastal town. If you are travelling from Mombasa then transport from Mombasa to Tiwi beach is best taken by taxi,  Don’t be tempted by the far cheaper tuk-tuks,  you will waste hours of your life bumping in slow motion towards your vacation destination, in Mombasa be aware you will also need to cross the Likoni ferry which can slow things up a bit.  If you are driving, the trip across the ferry costs 150 KSH for a car and they run every 10 minutes but the queues for them can be large. Matatu’s also run between Mombasa and Tiwi, it’s a crowded, hot and sticky affair but vastly cheaper.  There are also a couple of bus services, Flights from Nairobi to Mombasa and vice versa run a few times a day, take an hour and are cheap. (Approx 50 USD one way).  I recommend Jambo jet and Kenya Airways over the smaller airlines. Far easier to take the local flight from Nairobi Wilson airport to <b>Ukunda airport</b>. Ukunda is 10 minutes away from Diani. The flights are very frequent and they only take an hour. The are similar in cost to the flight to Mombasa. The <b>SGR train</b> runs a twice daily, very cheap, clean and comfortable service from <b>Nairobi to Mombasa</b> and makes a cheap, if lengthy alternative way to travel to Tiwi beach. It is entirely possible to drive to Tiwi from Nairobi, and many people do.  The journey takes between 8 hours on the well paved but very busy Mombasa highway.   You always have the option of stopping at Tsavo National Park en-route or driving through Shimba Hills National Reserve.

          <h2>Tiwi Marine Rangers </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The <b>Tiwi Marine Ranger Program</b>, which commenced in 2001, was the first Indigenous Marine Ranger Program in the Northern Territory. The program was developed in response to Traditional Owners wanting a more active role in sea country management. There were concerns about illegal fishing, the arrival of foreign vessels, and management of the internationally significant nesting sites for sea turtles, seabird rookeries and shorebird populations on the islands. The Tiwi program was so successful that it became the model for other Marine Ranger Programs across the Top End of the NT. Marine Ranger activities include coastal surveillance patrols, marine debris surveys, monitoring of <b>sea turtle</b> nesting and Crested Tern rookeries, visitor site management and raising community awareness about marine debris.

          <h2> Kenya Coast – Kenya </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Tiwi Beach is notably different from the other tourist destinations on the Kenya coast in its isolation and seclusion perhaps only <b>Mswambeni beach</b> is its equal. Starting at the widest and whitest pair of the South Coast’s stunning beaches:<b> Galu Beach</b> is relatively undeveloped, extending 25 km from the mangroves to a more privatized northern stretch. Side shore winds blow over mirror-flat water at low tide, but it gets choppy when the tide’s high. Kite Kenya ways Village up north has plenty of sandy lagoons, so low spring tides aren’t a problem – plus a consistent surfable beach-break. Launch further south on high springs as the north end will flood. Offshore, the break at Galu Reef pick up serious waves during a big swell (as can all of Kenya’s reef-breaks). <b>Diani Beach</b> is the hub of the South Coast scene, though low spring tides render it too shallow to ride. Launch from H2O Extreme, which offers all the essentials. <b>Galu Reef</b> ensures the water’s flat inside and provides waves for the adventurous. 25km up the road, <b>Tiwi River mouth</b> is a local 'secret spot’ worth a look during the dry monsoon (Dec-Feb). It’s unprotected by the reef so often gets a decent swell, but shifting sands make for an unpredictable break. Offshore winds mean it’s more of a <b>surfing</b> spot in Jun-Sep. The south of Tiwi Beach near Coral Cove Cottages is better as the north gets very rocky with narrow coves. The reef here is close inshore rendering it unsalable at low tide. <b>Nyali Beach</b> is good for beginners, if generally too light for advanced <b>windsurfers</b>. Side shore winds over very flat water at low tide that gets increasingly choppy towards high. The beach can get crowded but Nyali is handy for the airport and hotels, and makes a good stopover or safari base. Nyali Reef offers the usual offshore action. Nearby <b>Mombasa Old Town </b> and <b>Fort Jesus are</b> worth a visit. About a half-hour drive north, <b>Shanzu Beach</b> is much quieter – a picture of palm tree perfection, although rocky in places with very shallow low spring tides. Kitesurfing yet to catch on here, despite <b>Mtwapa Creek’s</b> glassy potential. If that’s your thing, an hour-and-a-half further north <b>Kilifi Creek</b> is a quiet little place that’s famed for its sailing. There are very flat conditions inside the Creek, although the wind can be gusty. The <b>North Coast</b> has sporadic stretches of clear beach among the rocks. The first is popular with weekenders from Nairobi, meaning the best of <b>Watamu Beach</b> is privatised, but Turtle Bay and Juja Rock offer access. Watamu Reef does its job of keeping the inside flat and offering waves to the more advanced. The spots either side of <b>Sabaki River</b> are markedly different: <b>Malindi Town</b> is more developed with white sand and clear water, best sailed at low tide as the beach floods at high. Contrastingly, Malindi Bay is brown with clean but murky water. There’s no reef protecting the Bay, allowing plenty of fun sets in. Loads of space, hardly any people on the beach – but there have been incidents of muggings. It’s arid this far north, and the sand-dunes make it look wild and deserted. The city of Malindi is famous for Vasco da Gama Point, marking the explorer’s last stop in Africa before sailing for India in the 15th century. For a 21st century taste of adventure, try the consistent beach-break at the vast 20km long Mambrui Beach, but be ready for a long hike to the water’s edge and don’t expect any creature comforts. Up towards the border with Somalia, the launch at Lamu Island is a 20-minute walk or donkey ride down a remote beach from the village of Shela. There’s wonderful kiting on a small lagoon, but it only works in Kusi winds (June-Sep) and beware of being swept downwind in the channel.
